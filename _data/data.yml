career-profile:
    title: Briefly about me and my programming
    summary: |
        I started with programming almost 20 years ago. During elementary and high school I took part (quite successfully) in math and programming competitions. At high school people from ČVUT and MFF UK led our IT lessons, which inspired me to study IT at MFF UK. I successfully finished 9 semesters.
        
        In 2009 I started to work as a (junior) web developer in web agencies. First few years at Genes Media, later I joined WeDeCom. Some time I also worked for Webtrh.
        
        After I stopped trying to pursuit my college degree I joined <a href="https://skrz.cz">Skrz.cz</a> (January 2016) where I've got most of my current experience.

my-role:
    title: My story at Skrz.cz
    summary: |
        In January 2016 I joined as a regular backend developer. In March 2017 I was offered a position of a lead developer which I accepted.

        Since then my standard developer responsibilities have been extended mainly by:

          - Creating product roadmaps with CEO and product owner
          - Analysis of complex problems
          - Keeping our company tech-stack up to date
          - Interviews with new candidates

why-me:
    title: Why might you want ME?
    summary: |
          - I'm a fast learner (ask my former CEO Petr Kováčik or my former CTO Jan Klat)
          - I understand both technological and product side of SW development (ask my current CEO Matěj Dvorský or product owner Miroslav Honysch)
          - People I work with respect me. And I respect them (ask my colleagues Luboš and Šimon)
          - Where others talk about problems and obstacles I see challenges and puzzles to be solved.

tech-stack:
    title: My tech stack from Skrz
    summary: |
        This is a list of tools and languages I've been intensively using during my work at Skrz, but I don't have a problem to learn anything new.

          - PHP + Symfony
          - MySQL / MariaDB
          - Elasticsearch, Elasticstack, Kibana
          - RabbitMQ
          - Redis
          - Golang
          - Jira
          - Sentry
          - PHPStorm
          - ... and many more

looking-for:
    title: What I'm looking for
    summary: |
        I'm not in any hurry to find a new job, but I'm definitely looking for:

          - Project(s) I'll enjoy working on
          - People I'll enjoy working with
          - Challenges I'll enjoy solving
          - Work that will enable improving my skills
          - Dog friendly office not too far from Prague - Malešice

other-stuff:
    title: Things I enjoy beside my work and other IT stuff
    summary: |
        I spend most of time in front of computer, but not all of it :)

          - <i class="fas fa-compass"></i> I love travelling with my family (wife, son and dog). 
          - <i class="fas fa-bicycle"></i> I like sports - running, skiing, cycling etc.
          - <i class="fas fa-book"></i> When I find some spare time and energy I also like to read (Stephen King, sci-fi, fantasy).
          - <i class="fas fa-puzzle-piece"></i> I enjoy puzzle hunts (or whatever should it be called in English) like "Tmou", "Matrix", etc.
